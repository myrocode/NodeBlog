# scope
NodeBlog.js is a simple Blog engine written in Node.js using the MVC pattern.
My personal goal for this project is to learn:

1. Get more confident with Javascript syntax
2. Node.js -> by building a simple blog engine and eventually move my blog (http://www.myrocode.com) on it.
3. Git -> get confident with git instead of SVN
4. mongodb -> an eventually mongose ORM
5. coffescript -> still thinking about that
6. ejs -> https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs

# installation
1. git clone git://github.com/myrocode/NodeBlog.git
2. cd src
3. npm install ejs
4. npm install router
5. node start.js
