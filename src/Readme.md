NodeBlog.js by Miro Radenovic
This is just my first experience with node.js.
The goal of this project is to learn:
1)Node.js -> by building a simple blog engine and eventually move my blog (http://www.myrocode.com) on it.
2)Git -> get confident with git instead of SVN
3)mongodb -> an eventually mongose ORM
4)coffescript -> still thinking about that
5)ejs -> https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs

# installation
1. git clone git://github.com/myrocode/NodeBlog.git
2. npm install ejs
3. npm install router
4. node start.js
